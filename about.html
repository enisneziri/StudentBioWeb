   							<p>Today I am a student at Universum College studying Computer<br>Sciences, at first programing was always hard cuz I did't know<br> from where to start, and that's the problem of a lot of people<br> about programing the start is hard but after you get started and<br> you are passionate about it you won't stop learning programing it<br> will be stuck to you like glue. So for me programing is the best<br> thing I started learning since I was born, we started learning <br>about 2 weeks ago and I've already learned the basics of html and<br> css. The proffesors are great and all the tools we need are <br>provided by the College so I would like to thank Universum for<br> this possibility that it has given us. In the future I want to<br>become a full stack web developer hopefully.</p>
